- This project referenced the AG2 notebook [task solving with code generation, execution, and debugging](https://docs.ag2.ai/notebooks/agentchat_auto_feedback_from_code_execution#a-comparative-analysis-of-meta-and-tesla-stocks-in-early-2024)

This project retrieves news and stock price changes for a given stock symbol (e.g., AAPL) and generates a summarized market analysis report.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Agent Flow Visualization

The system uses specialized agents working in parallel and sequential phases for comprehensive financial analysis:

## üìã Details

### üîÑ Analysis Workflow

1. **Step 1 - News Collection:** Retrieves 5 recent news articles from Yahoo Finance for the specified stock
2. **Step 2 - Price Analysis:** Gathers Monthly, 3-month, YTD, and 1-year stock price changes using Python code
3. **Step 3 - Visualization:** Creates and saves a 1-year stock price change graph as PNG
4. **Step 4 - Report Generation:** Produces comprehensive market analysis report in Markdown format
5. **Step 5 - Decision Support:** Provides investment recommendation (Buy/Sell/Hold) with supporting analysis

## Installation

1. Install dependencies using uv:

```bash
uv sync
```

2. Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API key
```

The primary dependency is the `ag2` library.

## Run the code

Before running the demo, you need to set up your OpenAI API configuration:


## Run the Demo

```bash
uv run python main.py
```

At the `Enter the stock you want to investigate: ` prompt, enter the stock symbol or stock name you want to investigate. For example, you can enter `AAPL` for Apple Inc. stock.

Checkout the generated `market_analysis_report.md` file for the summarized market analysis report.
