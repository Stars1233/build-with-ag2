# AI Game Design Agent Team

WIP: This project is currently not working properly.Latest release of AG2 0.9 introduced minor issues which will be fixed as soon as possible.

The AI Game Design Agent Team is a collaborative game design system that generates comprehensive game concepts through the coordination of multiple specialized AI agents, each focusing on different aspects of game design based on user inputs such as game type, target audience, art style, and technical requirements. This is built on AG2's new [swarm feature](https://docs.ag2.ai/notebooks/agentchat_swarm#swarm-orchestration-with-ag2) run through initiate_swarm_chat() method.

## Description

**Agents and Workflow**
We initialize context variables (e.g., project details, user inputs) to store the relevant game design requirements. The AI Game Design Agent Team comprises the following specialized agents:

- üé≠ Story Agent:
  Focuses on narrative design and world-building. Responsible for character backgrounds, lore, plot arcs, and dialogue.
- üéÆ Gameplay Agent:
  Specializes in game mechanics, systems design, resource management, progression, balancing, and overall gameplay flow.
- üé® Visuals Agent:
  Manages the art direction (including style guidelines, character/environment art, UI/UX) and also addresses audio elements like sound effects and music.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Agent:
  Provides technical architecture and implementation guidance‚Äîengine selection, optimization strategies, networking requirements, platform constraints, and development roadmap.

When a user provides high-level game requirements (e.g., game type, setting, audience, visuals, platform), we start the swarm to allocate requirements to the respective specialized agents. Each agent elaborates on its area of expertise, and final outputs are combined into a cohesive game design proposal.

## AG2 Features

This project demonstrates the following AG2 features:

- [Swarm Orchestration](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/user-guide/advanced-concepts/swarm-deep-dive)
- [Dynamic system message](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/user-guide/advanced-concepts/enhanced-swarm#agents-with-dynamic-system-message)

## Installation

1. Clone and navigate to the folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ag2ai/build-with-ag2.git
cd build-with-ag2/game_design_agent_team
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The two dependencies are the ag2 (AG2) library and streamlit.

## Run the code

Before you start, go to [OpenAI's platform](https://platform.openai.com/) to get an API key if you don't have one.

Run the Streamlit app to start a web interface for the AI Game Design Agent Team.

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

In the web interface to the left, put your OpenAI API key in the sidebar.

Now you can interact with it through your browser, and click `Generate Game Concept` to receive a comprehensive design output from the specialized agents.
